## ✅ CKBX! ✅

(NOTE: The project is inspired from the famous game: https://onemillioncheckboxes.com)

There are 1 million checkboxes. The game will finish when all checkboxes are checked! The game is live on Arbitrum network: https://ckbx.xyz

The rules are simple:

- In order to check or uncheck a box, you must deposit some fixed amount of ETH to the game! (Currently 0.0005 ETH ~ 1 USD)
- For each box you check/uncheck, some amount of CKBX will be minted for you (Initially 1.0 CKBX), the amount is halved each time!
- When the game ends:
    - The last person who checked the last box will receive 50% of all ETHs deposited! (Which will be at least 262 ETH ~ 500k USD)
    - The remaining 50% is distributed among CKBX holders!

Since the rewards of each checkbox is halved on every toggle, the total supply of the CKBX token will be limited: there can at most be 2 million CKBX tokens!

A CKBX holder somehow believes that the game will end eventually. His CKBX tokens are exchangable with real ETH after the game ends!

Either everyone wins or everyone loses! What will happen? Let's see!
